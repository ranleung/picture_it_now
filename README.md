# Picture It Now

Search by location to see and save user generated photos from Instagram.

## Overview

Currently on the Instagram app, one can not search photos strictly through locations.  You can only search by users or tags.

### Motivation

As our world is getting globalized as a result of technology, it is even easier to connect with people half way around the world than ever before.  I was motivated to build a project that would incorpate technology, traveling, and pictures.

Currently, through the Instagram app, photos are only searchable through tags and users.  What if I wanted to see what is currently happening in London, UK? or even Cape Town, South Africa?

What better way to discover a location than to find everyday people taking picture at that location?  So search away!
